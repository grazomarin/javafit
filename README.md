# JavaFit

## A Workout Tracker

**JavaFit** is a workout tracking platform designed to simplify exercise monitoring for individuals. It allows users to easily keep track of their workouts, including sets and reps well as create personalized workout plans. What sets JavaFit apart is its feature called 'Reps in Reserve' (RIR) which helps users gauge the intensity of their sessions. This feature proves invaluable for gym goers who seek to avoid overexertion or insufficient effort. JavaFit aims to cater to a range of individuals whether they are beginners or seasoned fitness enthusiasts by providing them with a comprehensive tool that aids in tracking progress and staying on course over time.

This project holds significance for me personally because I have a profound interest in bodybuilding and have always strived to find an efficient method of monitoring my workouts. I fully understand the importance of having a structured plan and being able to witness personal growth, which is why I believe JavaFit has immense potential, in simplifying and optimizing this entire process.
Combining my love for coding with my enthusiasm, for fitness appeared to be a blend and I'm thrilled to develop something that both myself and others who share my interests would find valuable.
